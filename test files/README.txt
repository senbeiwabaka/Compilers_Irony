****
NOTES : 
Automation - has a slight bug in that when it runs, anything other than 0 and 1 exit the program

Jacobi - still does not run because we still have not had to implement multi-dimensional arrays and Dr. O'Neil had talked about changing it just a one dimensional array

Sort Insertion - has a slight bug in, that when it runs, it does not swap variables correctly

Tax - crashes the program because a couple of the variables have not been initialized
